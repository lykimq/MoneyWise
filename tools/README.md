# 🚀 MoneyWise Development Tools

**Purpose**: Streamline MoneyWise project development with intelligent, type-safe tooling that automatically chooses the right approach for each task.

## 🎯 What This Solves

**Before**: The MoneyWise project has multiple script directories (`scripts/`, `moneywise-backend/`, `moneywise-app/`) with different tools for different tasks:
- `scripts/core/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `scripts/database/` - Database operations and schema management
- `scripts/setup/` - Environment setup and service management
- `scripts/testing/` - Test execution and validation
- `moneywise-backend/` - Rust backend operations
- `moneywise-app/` - React Native app operations

**The Problem**: Developers had to:
- Remember which script directory contains which tool
- Navigate between different project locations
- Use inconsistent command patterns across scripts
- Manually discover and execute the right script for each task
- Deal with different script languages (bash, rust, node) and setups

**After**: A single, intelligent interface that:
- **Unifies Access**: One command (`./tools/moneywise-hybrid.sh`) for all operations
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically finds and executes the right script or OCaml tool
- **Consistent Interface**: Same command pattern regardless of underlying implementation
- **Better Tooling**: Complex operations use type-safe OCaml, simple operations use efficient shell scripts
- **Centralized Control**: Manage all project operations from one place

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Hybrid Approach**: Use the right tool for each job
- **OCaml**: Complex operations requiring type safety, validation, and maintainability
- **Shell Scripts**: Simple file operations, environment setup, and basic commands
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically chooses the best approach

## 🛠️ What You Get

```bash
# One command for all operations
./tools/moneywise-hybrid.sh <command>

# Examples:
./tools/moneywise-hybrid.sh check      # Verify project prerequisites
./tools/moneywise-hybrid.sh status     # Show project health
./tools/moneywise-hybrid.sh test       # Execute test suite
./tools/moneywise-hybrid.sh setup      # Initialize project
```

## 📁 What's Inside

```
tools/
├── moneywise-hybrid.sh    # Main interface - use this for everything
├── ocaml/                 # Type-safe tools for complex operations
└── README.md              # This file
```

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

**Gradual Transition**:
- Keep existing scripts working
- Migrate complex operations to OCaml over time
- No big-bang rewrite required
- Maintain productivity during transition

**Future-Proof**:
- OCaml provides enterprise-grade reliability
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Structured code is easier to maintain
- Performance scales with project complexity

## 💡 Why This Matters

- **Development Velocity**: Spend time building features, not figuring out tools
- **Code Quality**: Type safety prevents errors before they reach production
- **Team Onboarding**: New developers can contribute faster
- **Maintenance**: Structured code is easier to debug and enhance
- **Scalability**: Tools grow with project complexity
