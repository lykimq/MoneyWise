# MoneyWise Root Setup Script
# =============================================================================
# This script orchestrates the complete setup of the MoneyWise project.
# It handles: project verification, backend setup, and frontend setup.
#
# Why this approach?
# - Single command setup from project root improves user experience
# - Orchestration separates concerns between root and backend scripts
# - Root script focuses on project-level setup, backend script handles details
# - Modular design allows backend script to be run independently if needed
# =============================================================================

set -e  # Exit immediately if any command fails (fail-fast approach)

# =============================================================================
# SOURCE SHARED UTILITIES
# =============================================================================
# Why source utilities? Eliminates code duplication and centralizes maintenance.
# The utilities script provides all common functions and prerequisite checking.
# =============================================================================

# PROJECT STRUCTURE VERIFICATION
# =============================================================================
# Why verify project structure first? Ensures we're in the correct directory.
# This prevents running the script from the wrong location and provides
# clear error messages about expected project structure.

# =============================================================================
# PREREQUISITES CHECK
# =============================================================================
# Why check prerequisites first? Fail early if essential tools are missing.
# This prevents wasting time on setup steps that will inevitably fail.
# We check the most critical tools needed for both backend and frontend.

# BACKEND SETUP ORCHESTRATION
# =============================================================================
# Why orchestrate backend setup? The root script delegates detailed backend
# configuration to a specialized script, maintaining separation of concerns.
# This allows the backend script to be run independently if needed.

# attempting to run it, providing clear error messages if missing.

    # Why chmod +x? Ensures the script has execute permissions.
    # This prevents permission errors when trying to run the script.

# restore_cd ensures we're back in the project root for the next steps.

# =============================================================================
# FRONTEND SETUP
# =============================================================================
# Why setup frontend after backend? Backend provides the API that frontend
# depends on, so ensuring backend is ready first prevents connection issues.
# Frontend setup is simpler - just dependency installation.
# =============================================================================
print_status "Setting up frontend..."

# Use safe directory change for frontend setup

# Why npm install? Installs all required packages defined in package.json.

# FINAL SUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS
# =============================================================================
